# Pool table homography + pool ball detection with OpenCV
## Kayden von Grosse and John Brown


A program that utilizes openCV to homographize an image of a pool table taken at nearly any angle, then identify the balls present, their colors, which team they belong to, and the 'best' next shot one would make (akin to a virtual pool game assistant).
